# To do list: 
# 1- use music21 instead of pretty_midi in PlayBackMusicFile, so that all app use signal musical library, 
# the music21 is comptabile with lilypond which is used to display the musical note, but not with fluidsynth
# I think that pretty_midi stores notes in flat shape, but in music more sophesticated structure is used !!. 
# 
# 2-Typically, music21 uses musescore to render the musical notes, this requies to install the musescore on the device,
# in streamlit share, simply But it in packages.txt and then to add the path of musescore into the music21 environment
# file, a good describtion can be found here :https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C1/C1S2_SymbolicRendering.html. 
# In our case, the follwoing error raises music21.converter.subConverters.SubConverterException: Cannot find a path to the 'mscore' file at /usr/bin/mscore3 -- download MuseScore
# I left some of the code here as reminder for me:
# us = music21.environment.UserSettings()
# us_path = us.getSettingsPath()
# if not os.path.exists(us_path):
#    us.create()
# us['musescoreDirectPNGPath'] = '/usr/share/sounds/sf3/default-GM.sf3'
# st.write('Path to music21 environment', us_path)
# st.write(us)

         Several AI models have been built and trained to match the variety of musical inputs ; furthermore, 
         the interface has been optimised to allow a user to add personal toutches and then to download the cratfed musical peices. 
         Wish this can aid the users to recogenise the potential rules that AI can play in art making. Source code is avaiavle free of charge at:
